## Credit Card Validation

This repository contains a simple credit card validator program written in Go. The program checks the validity of a given credit card number based on specific criteria.

### Functionality

The program includes the following functions:

#### `CardValidation(cardNumber string) bool`

The `CardValidation` function takes a credit card number as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the card number is valid or not. It performs the following steps:

1. It uses a regular expression pattern to validate the credit card number format. The pattern ensures that the card number starts with either 4, 5, or 6, followed by three digits, and then three groups of four digits separated by hyphens.
2. If the card number does not match the pattern, the function returns `false`, indicating an invalid card number.
3. If the card number matches the pattern, it removes any hyphens from the input using the `strings.ReplaceAll` function.
4. It then checks for consecutive repetition of digits in the card number by iterating over the characters up to the third-to-last character.
5. If four consecutive characters are the same, the function returns `false`, indicating an invalid card number.
6. If the card number passes all the checks, the function returns `true`, indicating a valid card number.

#### `main()`

In the `main` function, the program performs the following steps:

1. It reads the number of credit card numbers to validate from the user.
2. It uses a loop to read each credit card number and validate it using the `CardValidation` function.
3. If a card number is valid, the program prints "Valid". Otherwise, it prints "Invalid".

### Usage

To use this credit card validator program, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that you have Go installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the source code files.
3. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
4. Build the program using the command `go build`.
5. Run the program using the command `./<executable_name>` (replace `<executable_name>` with the actual name of the executable generated by the build process).
6. Enter the number of credit card numbers you want to validate when prompted.
7. Enter each credit card number, one at a time, and press Enter after each input.
8. The program will validate each credit card number and print "Valid" or "Invalid" for each input.

### Example

Here's an example usage of the credit card validator program:
INPUT:
6
4123456789123456
5123-4567-8912-3456
61234-567-8912-3456
4123356789123456
5133-3367-8912-3456
5123 - 3567 - 8912 - 3456

OUTPUT:

Valid
Valid
Invalid
Valid
Invalid
Invalid

In the above example, the user inputs 3 credit card numbers. The program validates each number and prints "Valid" or "Invalid" based on the validation result.
